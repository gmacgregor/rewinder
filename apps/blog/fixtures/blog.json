I'd draw something up on paper, boot Photoshop, work tirelessly at it for hours on end, fall in love with it... and then drop it completely a week later in favour of something else. The problem with design after design was less a creative one (I didn't hate the design, per se) and more due to a lack of content: I had no idea *what* was going to appear on the website I was working on, just that *something* would fill in the gaps. \r\n\r\nAs a web developer, I really wanted to build the guts of the website myself-- for the challenge of it all. So I jumped on board the Ruby on Rails train (it was 2006ish), digested as much about both Ruby and Rails as I could and then I gave up. Something just didn't feel right. I liked Rails and I liked Ruby but I didn't love either of them. For whatever reason, I didn't want to turn to Wordpress or another \"out of the box\" solution. I felt defeated and depressed and went into hiding with a blanket and a carton of smokes. \r\n\r\nThen, in early 2007, I found [Django](http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com). As I read more and more about both the Django framework and the programming language Python I knew I was on to something. Python code itself is quite beautiful and it helped that the Django project itself originated at a small newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas (I also work at a newspaper). I figured I'd give the whole website thing a shot, again.\r\n\r\nLate in fall 2007, I finally started thinking up ideas for that whole content part of the website. I knew that just having a simple blog wouldn't be enough. I wanted to bring all of my online activity- all of the links I've collected over the years, photos I've taken, videos I've laughed at- [into one place](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tumblelog) (besides, I knew I didn't have it in me to blog every day to give the site that \"updated\" feel). \r\n\r\nAnd that's what I've done: I've [consolidated my online activity](\/tumblelog\/). The idea and the implementation is nothing new or radical but it's what I've wanted to do and now I've done it. And that makes me happy.\r\n\r\n#### Hello, world\r\n\r\nWhat you see here is [every link I've ever saved to del.icio.us](\/links\/), [every photo](\/photos\/) that I've ever uploaded to flickr.com, [videos](\/videos\/) that I have enjoyed and [status updates](\/tweets\/) posted to twitter (since April, 2008). Content is mainly browseable by date. For example:\r\n\r\n* Want to see all of the photos I took in August, 2007? [Look no further](\/photos\/2007\/08\/).\r\n* Wondering what I did online on February 20th, 2008? [Here you go](\/tumblelog\/2008\/02\/20\/).\r\n* Interested in links I saved in 2006? [They're right here](\/links\/2006\/).\r\n\r\nYou can also browse content by [associated tags](\/tags\/) (everything but twitter status updates have associated tags).\r\n\r\n#### Design and Browser Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe design itself is nothing to write home about and was, in fact, the last thing I really took on. I wanted to keep it simple and I think I've accomplished that.  That being said, I don't *love* the design... so it's bound to change in the relatively near future.\r\n\r\nIf you're on a Mac, the one and only typeface you'll (probably) see being used across the site is Helvetica Neue. If you're running Vista on a PC, you'll get Calibri. If you don't have Helvetica Neue or Calibri installed on your system you'll get either Helvetica or Arial. Apologies for the latter...\r\n\r\nIf you're using the latest release of either Firefox, Safari or Opera as your web browser then things should look just fine.  I still haven't completely tested in Internet Explorer 7-- I'm sure there are things that don't look right. I **do not** intend on offering support for Internet Explorer 6 or below. If you are using this browser, you should really [get](http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/) [something](http:\/\/www.opera.com\/download\/) [better](http:\/\/www.apple.com\/safari\/).\r\n\r\n#### Thanks\r\n\r\nI couldn't have put all of this together without Jesse Legg's [django-syncr](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/django-syncr\/), James Bennett's [django-comment-utils](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/django-comment-utils\/) and the [django-users](http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/django-users) Google group. Thanks also go to both [Victor Ng](http:\/\/crankycoder.com\/) and [Ian Stevens](http:\/\/crazedmonkey.com\/blog\/) for answering Python-related questions.\r\n\r\nThanks also goes to The Fiancee for being supportive despite the many hours I've spent in front of the computer and to everyone involved with the Django project.\r\n\r\nI guess that's it for now. Take a look around, let me know what you think, and please [email me any bugs](\/about\/) you might come across.",
